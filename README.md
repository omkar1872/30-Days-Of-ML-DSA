# 45 Days of Machine Learning & DSA

Welcome to my 45-day journey of mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. This repository showcases my progress, solutions, and projects related to these fields. The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills and gain hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning models.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to two major areas of study:

### Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Comprehensive solutions to various problems across **LeetCode** and other platforms.
- Implementations of classic data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, etc.).
- Algorithms covering **Sorting**, **Searching**, **Dynamic Programming**, and **Graph Traversal**.

### Machine Learning (ML)
- Implementation of foundational ML algorithms, including **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Neural Networks**.
- Hands-on projects involving data analysis, model building, and performance evaluation.
- Practical use of **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and other libraries for building and fine-tuning models.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, GitHub

## Highlights

- **DSA Problem-Solving**: Solutions to a variety of DSA problems ranging from beginner to advanced levels, with detailed explanations and time/space complexity analysis.
- **ML Projects**: End-to-end machine learning projects, from data preprocessing to model deployment, showcasing the full cycle of building and optimizing machine learning solutions.
- **Code Quality**: Emphasis on clean, readable code with modular implementations, proper documentation, and testing.
